# Letterboxd Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes my personal **Letterboxd ratings** data to uncover patterns in my movie preferences, specifically exploring how I rate movies based on **genre**, **release year**, and **runtime**. The analysis involves visualizing trends in movie ratings, performing statistical hypothesis testing, and applying machine learning techniques for predictive modeling. By examining my ratings over time, I aim to identify any shifts in genre preferences and rating behavior.

The primary objectives of the analysis are:
- Which genres and years (by decade) receive the highest ratings?
- How do my ratings vary across different categories, such as movie runtime and director?
- Have my movie ratings changed over time, particularly comparing films released before and after a selected year (e.g., 2000)?

## Dataset

The dataset consists of my **Letterboxd film ratings**, which can be accessed from my [Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/eminthesecond/films/). The data includes the following attributes for each movie:

- **Title**: The name of the movie
- **Genres**: One or more genres assigned to the movie
- **Release Year**: The year the movie was released
- **Average Rating**: The rating I assigned to the movie (on a 5-star scale)
- **Runtime**: Duration of the movie in minutes
- **Director**: The director(s) of the movie

The data is extracted using the Letterboxd CSV export functionality and cleaned to ensure consistency, including handling missing values, normalizing genre labels, and adding additional columns such as `Decade` for more granular analysis.

### Data Considerations:
- The dataset includes only films rated by me, excluding TV series and short films.
- Some genres are mapped to more general categories for better consistency and analysis.
- The project focuses on a large sample of rated movies to detect meaningful trends across genres and years.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python** for data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations (e.g., bar plots, line plots, scatter plots)
- **SciPy** for hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests)
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning (e.g., KMeans clustering, linear regression, random forest regression)
- **Statsmodels** for statistical modeling (e.g., OLS regression)

## Analysis Plan

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**:
   - The data is extracted from my Letterboxd profile and cleaned using Pandas. Missing values in the `Average_rating` and `Runtime` columns are filled with the median values. Genres are normalized using a predefined mapping to reduce inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Various visualizations are created to explore the data, including:
     - **Average Ratings by Genre**: A horizontal bar plot to show which genres tend to receive the highest ratings.
     - **Average Ratings by Decade**: A line plot showing trends in ratings over different decades.
     - **Number of Ratings by Genre**: A bar plot to visualize how many movies are rated within each genre.
     - **Runtime vs. Average Rating**: A scatter plot exploring any correlation between movie runtime and rating.
     - **Yearly Trend of Ratings**: A line plot showing how ratings have evolved over time.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - A t-test is conducted to compare the average ratings of movies released before and after a specific year (e.g., 2000) to determine if my ratings have changed over time. The null hypothesis is that the average ratings for both periods are the same.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - **KMeans Clustering**: Movies are grouped into clusters based on their runtime and rating using KMeans clustering.
   - **Linear Regression**: A linear regression model is built to predict movie ratings based on factors like runtime, release year, and decade.
   - **Random Forest Regression**: A random forest model is used to assess which features (e.g., runtime, release year) most influence my ratings.

5. **Genre Preferences Over Time**:
   - Using a heatmap, we analyze how my genre preferences have changed across decades, helping to reveal any patterns in genre ratings over time.

6. **Additional Insights**:
   - Further analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between movie length and ratings, identify top-rated directors, and examine correlations between different features (e.g., runtime and average rating).

## Example Plots

Here are a few of the key plots generated by the analysis:

- **Average Ratings by Genre**: A bar plot showing the average ratings across different genres.
- **Average Ratings by Decade**: A line plot revealing how my ratings have evolved over time.
- **Average Ratings Before and After a Specific Year**: A bar plot comparing my ratings for movies released before and after the year 2000.
- **Movie Clustering**: A scatter plot showing how movies are clustered based on their runtime and ratings.

## Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- Certain genres, such as **Drama** and **Sci-Fi**, consistently receive higher ratings compared to others.
- My ratings have evolved over time, with a noticeable shift in preferences after the year 2000.
- **Movie runtime** does not show a strong correlation with ratings, but there are clear preferences for specific movie lengths.
- **Directors** play a significant role in determining ratings, with certain filmmakers consistently producing movies that receive higher ratings.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations:
- The dataset excludes TV shows and short films, which could potentially reveal different rating patterns.
- Genre mapping is subjective and may overlook some nuances in film categorization.
- The project focuses on movie ratings without considering factors like personal viewing context (e.g., theater vs. home viewing).

### Future Work:
- **Director and Actor Analysis**: Further exploration of directors and actors who consistently produce high-rated films.
- **More Advanced Predictive Models**: Experimenting with additional machine learning models (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks) to improve rating predictions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporating movie reviews to enhance the analysis by evaluating how sentiment correlates with ratings.
